# JC's Game Of Life

# Analysis
A paragraph to describe the problem area:
Cellular Automata: a system involving a finitely dimensioned grid, where cells can exist in one of a finite number of states (e.g. on and off), and where a cell's neibourhood is directly affected by it, under a finite number of rules, usually a mathmatical function.

A paragraph to describe the specific problem:
Creating a working version of Conway's Game Of Life (one of the more famous cellular automata) using Processing. This involves making a system that can create and delete life depending on patterns on an interface.

A numbered list to describe how the problem was researched
1) Google Search Conway's Game Of Life.
2) Do some programming

Full details of the user(s)
A user will press start, and look at the pretty patterns for fun.

Feedback from a third part to find out if the analysis is detailed and clear enough

A numbered list of objectives for the project
1) Create a functioning version of Conway's game of life.
2) Maybe create an interactive interface so that a user can create their own start patterns

For each objective, a measure of the extent to which it has been achieved

A model of a representation of the problem, possibly a drawing.
